# Graphs
Visualization of BFS, DFS and A* algorithm

This Repository is created to provide a visualization using Python's Matplotlib package of some algortithms to traverse a graph.

It contains:

1. BFS_Visualization.py
   This script uses a Queue and Node objects defined in the utils directory to perform Breadth-First Search on a graph. Once this script is run,
   it will show 4 different cases on how the BFS would traverse the graph to find the target node. 
   
2. DFS_Visualization.py
   This script uses a Node object defined in the utils directory and a stack (built-in Python list) to perform Depth-First Search on a graph. Once this script is run,
   it will show 4 different cases on how the DFS would traverse the graph to find the target node. 
   
Note: Currently working on algorithms for directed graphs such as A*.
